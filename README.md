## ü§î How to push HTML or non TypeScript files?

If you need to push some other files that will not be included in transpilation process, you can put them into *app/* folder *(or whatever location you want if you change ***.claspignore*** configuration)*.

Put your assets in here, meaning some HTML or any JavaScript file you need to be pushed to Google Apps Script.
